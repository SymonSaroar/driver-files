The DriverWizard has created:
* A sample diagnostics application for testing the communication with
  your hardware from the user mode.
* Library files, which include API for controlling your hardware.

  /data01/drive/driver/driver_files.txt
         A detailed overview of all the generated files.

  /data01/drive/driver/driver_lib.h
         A library for controlling your hardware through WinDriver.

  /data01/drive/driver/driver_lib.c
         Contains the implementation of the functions used for
         accessing each of the resources defined in the Wizard.

  /data01/drive/driver/driver_diag.c
         The sample user-mode application that diagnoses your
         hardware using the driver_lib.c library.

  /data01/drive/driver/linux/makefile
         Linux makefile.

  /data01/drive/driver/driver.inf
         A formatted reference file for Windows that contains
         information about installation files and devices, such as
         filenames, version information and so on.

Compiling this project:
  For Linux, run  - "make -C linux"

Converting to a GUI application:
  This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than
  a GUI application) that uses standard input and standard output.
  This was done in order to simplify the source code. You may change it
  into a GUI application by removing all calls to printf() and scanf()
  functions, and calling MessageBox() instead.
